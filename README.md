**EcoXpert Pro** is a next-generation economy plugin designed to solve the most common problem in Minecraft servers: **economic collapse and inflation**. Unlike traditional economy plugins, EcoXpert implements intelligent algorithms that prevent economic breakdown and maintain a healthy, engaging economy for players.

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

> **"An economy that doesn't collapse"**

Traditional servers follow this pattern:
- **Day 1:** Players start with $100
- **Day 30:** Average balance $50,000
- **Day 60:** Average balance $500,000  
- **Day 90:** Economy broken - players have everything, nothing has value

**EcoXpert prevents this** through intelligent market dynamics, anti-inflation systems, and advanced economic modeling.

## 🧠 **Economic Intelligence System - The Revolution**

### What Makes EcoXpert Different

Traditional economy plugins are **static** - they provide commands and basic functionality, but the economy inevitably collapses as players accumulate infinite wealth.

**EcoXpert's Economic Intelligence System creates a LIVING economy that:**

### 🌱 **Economic Cycles - The Economy "Breathes"**
```
🔄 DEPRESSION → RECESSION → STABLE → GROWTH → BOOM → BUBBLE → RECESSION...
```

The economy naturally cycles through different phases, just like real economies:
- **Depression:** Deflation, low activity - System provides stimulus
- **Recession:** Mild economic slowdown - Careful monetary policy
- **Stable:** Balanced conditions - Normal operations
- **Growth:** Economic expansion - Increased opportunities
- **Boom:** High activity period - Great time for investments
- **Bubble:** Overheated economy - System applies cooling measures

### 🤖 **Player Economic Personalities**

The system analyzes each player's behavior and assigns them an economic personality:

- **🏦 Saver** - Tends to save money, low spending
- **💸 Spender** - High spending, low savings  
- **📈 Trader** - Active market participant
- **💰 Investor** - Long-term wealth building
- **🎲 Speculator** - High-risk, high-reward behavior
- **🐉 Hoarder** - Accumulates wealth, minimal transactions
- **❤️ Philanthropist** - Generous, helps other players
- **⚠️ Exploiter** - Attempts to exploit economic systems

### 🔮 **Predictive Economic Modeling**

The system maintains an **Economic Memory** that:
- Learns from historical patterns
- Predicts future economic conditions
- Identifies potential crises before they happen
- Recommends optimal intervention strategies

### 🚨 **Intelligent Crisis Prevention**

**Automatic Anomaly Detection:**
- Rapid economic health changes
- Extreme inflation/deflation
- Wealth inequality spikes
- Market volatility warnings
- Unusual activity patterns

**Smart Interventions:**
- **Emergency Stimulus** - Crisis response with targeted money injection
- **Monetary Easing** - Lower interest rates, increase money supply
- **Monetary Tightening** - Combat inflation with policy changes
- **Market Stimulation** - Encourage trading activity
- **Wealth Redistribution** - Address inequality issues

### 📊 **Economic Health Monitoring**

Real-time tracking of:
- **Economic Health** (0-100%) - Overall economy condition
- **Inflation Rate** - Current price level changes
- **Velocity of Money** - How fast money circulates
- **Gini Coefficient** - Wealth inequality measurement
- **Market Volatility** - Economic stability indicator

### Intelligent Economy Policy (overview)
- Runtime adjustments via `/ecoxpert economy policy`:
  - `show`: print current policy and global market factors.

  - Stagnation: mild market stimulation (time‑bound).
  - Continuous bias: gentle ±3% max according to health/inflation.

### YAML Modules
- `modules/inflation.yml`: self‑regulation policy (wealth tax, market factors, intervention windows). Safe defaults, adjust gently.

### Events Settings (weights)
- Each event in `modules/events.yml` supports `weight` to bias selection.
- Higher weight increases probability when conditions trigger an event.
- The Events Admin GUI shows per-type weight and cooldown status.

### Loans Settings
- File: `modules/loans.yml`
- Keys:
  - `policy.rate.min/base/max`: total loan fee fraction bounds.
  - `policy.term_days.min/max`: min/max term in days.
  - `policy.max_amount.multiplier_balance/floor`: cap per balance and base floor.
  - `policy.payments.frequency_days`: schedule frequency (currently daily).
  - `policy.late.penalty_rate` and `policy.late.notify`.
  - `policy.late.penalty_cap_fraction`: max cumulative penalty over principal (e.g., 0.50 = +50%).

  - `scheduler.interval_minutes`: delinquency sweep interval.

Loans Delinquency Scheduler
- Overdue installments are marked LATE and a penalty is applied to the loan’s outstanding.
- Penalty application respects `policy.late.penalty_cap_fraction` to avoid runaway growth.
- Player overdue notifications are rate-limited using `policy.late.notify_cooldown_minutes`.

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Economy Takeover System
The plugin automatically detects your server setup. For manual control:

```yaml
# config.yml
economy:
  takeover:
    enabled: true
    mode: "auto"  # auto, takeover, compatibility, safe
    sync_interval: 60  # seconds
    
  migration:
    import_on_startup: true        # import balances at startup if another Vault economy is active
    backup_before_import: true     # create a DB backup before importing
```

### Update Checker
```yaml
plugin:
  updates:
    check-enabled: true
    resource-id: 0                 # Spigot resource id (legacy API). 0 = disabled unless check-url is set
    check-url: ""                 # Optional custom URL returning the latest version string
    download-url: "https://github.com/koyere/ecoxpert"
```

### Configuration Mode (Simple vs Advanced)
- `plugin.config_mode`: `advanced` (default) or `simple`.
- Simple mode applies curated defaults and exposes only a few top-level knobs in `config.yml` under `simple.*`.

Simple mode keys (top-level `config.yml`)
```yaml
plugin:
  config_mode: "simple"
simple:
  market:
    max_price_change: 0.15
    volatility_damping: 0.90
    trend_analysis_hours: 24
  inflation:
    target: 1.02    # 2% target
  policy:
    wealth_tax_rate: 0.005
```
Advanced mode keeps using `modules/*.yml` for full control.

### Educational Messages (opt-in)
- `education.enabled`: true/false.
- `education.broadcasts`: `cycle|events|policy` toggles.
- `education.cooldowns`: anti‑spam cooldowns in minutes (`cycle_minutes`, `events_minutes`, `policy_player_minutes`).
- Messages are localized (EN/ES) under `education.*` keys.
- Examples:
  - Cycle change: "The economy entered BUBBLE; sharp price increases likely."
  - Event start: generic line with Δ Buy/Sell and category when available.
  - Policy (wealth tax): per-player notice when applied (once per iteration).

### Market Settings
```yaml
market:
  price_update_interval: 300  # 5 minutes
  max_price_change: 0.20      # 20% max change per update
  volatility_damping: 0.85    # Reduces extreme volatility
  trend_analysis_hours: 24    # Historical data for trends
```

## 🔌 Integrations (Overview)

EcoXpert applies light, contextual adjustments when the following plugins are detected:

- WorldGuard (`territory.worldguard.rules`)
  - Region glob rules like `city_*`, `market_*`, etc. with `buy_factor` / `sell_factor`.
- Lands (`territory.lands`)
  - Name glob entries plus `default` for areas without land.
- Towny (`territory.towny`)
  - Town glob rules and `default`.
  - Phase 2: population-based scaling via `scaling.thresholds` (highest reached threshold wins).
- Jobs Reborn (`jobs.dynamic.inflation.thresholds`)
  - Reduces payouts when inflation crosses configured thresholds (soft hook via reflection).
- Slimefun (`slimefun.inflationary.*`)
  - Per-material factors for “inflationary” items; optional auto-flagging by abundance (window/threshold/duration).
- mcMMO
  - Detection plus gentle global adjustments via `adjustments.mcmmo.*`.

Global detection factors
- `integrations.yml → adjustments` applies soft multipliers (≈±1–2%) when each plugin is present.

Diagnostics
- `/ecoxpert integrations` shows detected plugins and rule counts per system.

#### **Add EcoXpert as Dependency**

**Maven (pom.xml):**
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ecoxpert-repo</id>
        <url>https://github.com/koyere/ecoxpert</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>me.koyere</groupId>
        <artifactId>ecoxpert</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**plugin.yml:**
```yaml
depend: [EcoXpert]
# or for optional integration:
softdepend: [EcoXpert]
```

#### **API Best Practices**

1. **Always check if API is ready** before using services
2. **Use CompletableFuture properly** - all async operations return futures
3. **Handle null responses** - some methods may return null if data doesn't exist
4. **Respect async operations** - avoid blocking `.join()` on main thread
5. **Cache service instances** - get them once and reuse

API Events (Bukkit)
- `EconomyCycleChangeEvent` — fired on cycle transitions (e.g., GROWTH → BOOM).
- `MarketPriceChangeEvent` — fired when an item's price changes more than `market.api.events.price_change_threshold_percent` (default 15%).
- `WealthTaxAppliedEvent` — fired after wealth tax is applied (rate, threshold, affectedAccounts).

### API Usage Examples

- Get API instance and server snapshot
```
EcoXpertAPI api = org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin.getPlugin(me.koyere.ecoxpert.EcoXpertPlugin.class)
  .getServiceRegistry().getInstance(me.koyere.ecoxpert.api.EcoXpertAPI.class);
var snap = api.getServerEconomics();
getLogger().info("Cycle=" + snap.getCycle() + ", Health=" + (int)(snap.getEconomicHealth()*100) + "%");
```

- Forecast cycle for next 24 hours
```
var forecast = api.forecastCycle(java.time.Duration.ofHours(24));
getLogger().info("Forecast Cycle=" + forecast.getCycle() + ", Confidence=" + (int)(forecast.getConfidence()*100) + "%");
```

- Player economy view (percentile and risk)
```
java.util.UUID uuid = player.getUniqueId();
var view = api.getPlayerEconomyView(uuid);
getLogger().info("Percentile=" + String.format("%.0f%%", view.getWealthPercentile()*100) + 
                 ", Risk=" + String.format("%.0f%%", view.getRiskScore()*100));
```

- Listen to API events
```
@org.bukkit.event.EventHandler
public void onCycle(me.koyere.ecoxpert.api.events.EconomyCycleChangeEvent e) {
  getLogger().info("Cycle changed: " + e.getOldCycle() + " → " + e.getNewCycle());
}

@org.bukkit.event.EventHandler
public void onPrice(me.koyere.ecoxpert.api.events.MarketPriceChangeEvent e) {
  getLogger().info("Price change (" + e.getMaterial() + ") oldBuy=" + e.getOldBuy() + " newBuy=" + e.getNewBuy());
}

@org.bukkit.event.EventHandler
public void onWealthTax(me.koyere.ecoxpert.api.events.WealthTaxAppliedEvent e) {
  getLogger().info("WealthTax: rate=" + e.getRate() + " threshold=" + e.getThreshold() + 
                   " affected=" + e.getAffectedAccounts());
}
```

### Integrations (soft hooks)
- WorldGuard: read-only region names by location (used in placeholders).
- Lands: read-only land name by location (used in placeholders).
- Integrations config: `modules/integrations.yml` (detect Jobs/Towny/Lands/Slimefun/McMMO). Actualmente detección‑only; futuras iteraciones podrán aplicar ajustes suaves.
- Startup logs include a summary line: "Integrations detected → WorldGuard=..., Lands=..., Jobs=..., Towny=..., Slimefun=..., McMMO=...".
 - Dynamic adjustments (phase 1): gentle buy/sell factors can be enabled per integration in `modules/integrations.yml` → `adjustments.*`. Factors are very mild (±1%) and apply on final amounts (buy/sell), visible in Effective Buy/Sell.

## 🚀 **Advanced Features**

### Intelligent Market Algorithms
- **Supply/Demand Analysis** - 24-hour historical data
- **Volatility Calculations** - Standard deviation of prices  
- **Momentum Analysis** - Transaction velocity tracking
- **Safety Constraints** - Min 10%, Max 1000% of base price

### Anti-Exploitation Systems
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents transaction spam
- **Audit Trails** - Complete transaction history
- **Integrity Verification** - Transaction hash validation
- **Auto-Freeze** - Suspicious account detection

### Economic Modeling
- **Inflation Control** - Dynamic money supply management
- **Market Trends** - 6-tier trend classification system
- **Price Forecasting** - Predictive price modeling
- **Economic Events** - Automated economic interventions

### Order Book (optional)
- Fixed-price listings coexist with the dynamic market engine.
- Sellers lock items upfront with `/market list <item> <qty> <unit_price> [hours]`.
- Buyers purchase with `/market buyorder <id> <qty>`; open orders: `/market orders [item]`.
- Orders GUI: paginated with sorting (price/remaining/expires asc/desc), quick quantity selector (1/8/16/32/MAX) and confirmation when total exceeds threshold.
- Confirmation threshold: `modules/market.yml` → `orders.confirm_threshold` (default 5000.0).
- Listing UX (MarketGUI → right‑click on item): price adjustment presets, quantities, and duration buttons configurable in `modules/market.yml` under `orders.listing`.
 - Absolute presets supported: configure `orders.listing.price_adjust_presets_absolute` (e.g., `[-100, 100, 500]`), rendered alongside percent buttons.

Example configuration (modules/market.yml)
```yaml
orders:
  confirm_threshold: 5000.0
  listing:
    price_adjust_presets_percent: [-10, -5, -1, 1, 5, 10]   # percent buttons
    price_bounds_min_base_fraction: 0.10                    # min = 10% of base sell price
    price_bounds_max_base_fraction: 10.0                    # max = 1000% of base sell price
    duration_hours_options: [12, 24, 48]                    # listing durations (hours)
    price_adjust_presets_absolute: [-100, 100, 500]         # absolute currency deltas
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Q: Commands don't work with EssentialsX**
A: Use `/ecoxpert` instead of `/eco` to avoid conflicts. EcoXpert detects conflicts automatically.

**Q: Balances not syncing**
A: If using EssentialsX/CMI, balances are imported automatically a few seconds after startup (if enabled). You can also run `/ecoxpert migrate balances`.

**Q: Market prices seem wrong**
A: Market uses real supply/demand. Prices adjust based on actual trading activity.

**Q: Banking features not available**
A: Banking system requires full database setup. Check logs for initialization errors.

### MySQL Database Connection Issues

**Q: Error `Failed to initialize pool: Unsupported character encoding 'utf8mb4'`**

A: Your MySQL server doesn't support `utf8mb4` charset. EcoXpert automatically handles this with charset fallback:

**Solution (Automatic):**
1. Delete the `ecoxpert` database in MySQL
2. Restart your server
3. Plugin creates database with compatible charset automatically

**Recommended MySQL Versions:**
- MySQL 5.7.7+ (full utf8mb4 support)
- MySQL 8.0+ (recommended, best performance)
- MariaDB 10.2+ (full compatibility)

**Manual Solution (if automatic fails):**
```sql
-- Option 1: Create with utf8mb4 (MySQL 5.7.7+)
CREATE DATABASE ecoxpert CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Option 2: Create with utf8 fallback (older MySQL)
CREATE DATABASE ecoxpert CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

-- Grant privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ecoxpert.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Q: Error `Connection timeout` or `Communications link failure`**

A: MySQL server is not accessible. Verify:
- MySQL is running and accepting connections
- Host and port in `config.yml` are correct
- Firewall allows connection (default port 3306)
- Test connection: `mysql -h <host> -P 3306 -u <user> -p`

**Q: Error `Access denied for user`**

A: MySQL credentials are incorrect. Verify in `config.yml`:
- Username and password are correct
- User has `CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` privileges on the database
- Re-grant privileges:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ecoxpert.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging in `config.yml`:
```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
```
